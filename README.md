# Eye-exercise-for-Google-Chrome
A Google Chrome extension for consistent and long time computer users. After consistent 1 hour uses of chrome, an alert will appear on the extension icon. On clicking on the extension icon, a new tab will open which will start the exercise.
"myScript.js" is the file which contains the code for exercises. Feel free to add more!
"two.min.js" is a minified version of the "Two.js" javascript library for animations and drawings.
